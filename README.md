# Motion-Detection-VideoPlayer
This project is a Python-based video player with integrated motion detection and alert functionality. The video player allows users to select a video file, play/pause it, seek forward or backward, and define a region of interest (ROI) on the video where motion is monitored. If motion is detected within the defined area, an alert sound is triggered.

## Features

- Play/Pause video playback.
- Seek forward or backward by 5 seconds.
- Define a region of interest (ROI) by selecting four points on the video.
- Monitor motion within the defined ROI.
- Trigger an alert sound if motion is detected.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the following Python packages:
