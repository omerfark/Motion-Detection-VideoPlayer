# Motion-Detection-VideoPlayer
This project is a Python-based video player with integrated motion detection and alert functionality. The video player allows users to select a video file, play/pause it, seek forward or backward, and define a region of interest (ROI) on the video where motion is monitored. If motion is detected within the defined area, an alert sound is triggered.
